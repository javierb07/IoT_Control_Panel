# IoT Control Panel
Dashboard to control and monitor machines connected to smart plugs

Connect machines or devices to smart plugs and control (turn them on or off) and monitor (see power consumption) them.

Tested and developed connecting 4 machines and devices to Wemo Insight Smart Plug.

See https://github.com/iancmcc/ouimeaux for an API to set up and environment with Wemo plugs.

Should work with smart plugs that accept http requests for control.
